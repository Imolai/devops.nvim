INTRODUCTION                                                     *devops.nvim*

Devops.nvim is a project to help you get started on your Neovim journey in
DevOps World.

                                                               *devops-is-not*
It is not:
- Complete framework for every plugin under the sun.
- Place to add every plugin that could ever be useful.

                                                                   *devops-is*
It is:
- Somewhere that has a good start for the basic DevOps IDE type features:
    - autocompletion
    - linting
    - formatting
    - goto-definition
    - find references
    - fuzzy finding
    - and hinting at what more can be done :)
- A place to start your DevOps development journey.
    - You should fork this project and use/modify it so that it matches your
      style and preferences. If you don't want to do that, there are probably
      other projects that would fit much better for you (and that's great!)!
